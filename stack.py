"""The stack data structure is used in situations where the most recent value should be the first returned. This is called LIFO(Last In First Out), a real world example would be a stack of dishes, the bottom dish was put there first, and if new dishes are added they are added to the top.  Sometimes I load new dishes to the bottom to give the bottom plates a chance to be used, but you don't do that with stacks,  The methods associated with stacks are empty(), size(), top(), push(item), and pop()"""
